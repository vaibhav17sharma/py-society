# My First Python Learning Project

Welcome to my first Python learning project! This project is a basic implementation to help me get familiar with Python and database interactions using MySQL.

## Project Overview

This project includes:

- **Database Schema**: Defines tables for managing towers, flats, residents, parkings, charges, users, and logs.
- **Database Connection**: Uses Python to connect to a MySQL database.
- **Data Seeding**: Includes a script to create tables and insert initial data if the tables are empty.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- MySQL server
- `mysql-connector-python` package
